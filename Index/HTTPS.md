## HTTPS

The HTTP protocol uses plain TCP as its transport mechanism, which is unencrypted and therefore can be intercepted by an attacker who is suitably positioned on the network. HTTPS is essentially the same application-layer protocol as HTTP but is tunneled over the secure transport mechanism, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This protects the privacy and integrity of data passing over the network, reducing the possibilities for noninvasive interception attacks. HTTP requests and responses function in exactly the same way regardless of whether SSL is used for transport.

> SSL has strictly been superseded by transport layer security (TLS), but the latter usually still is referred to using the older name.

## Advantage of HTTPS

- __Secure Communication:__ https makes a secure connection by establishing an encrypted link between the browser and the server or any two systems.
- __Data Integrity:__ https provides data integrity by encrypting the data and so, even if hackers manage to trap the data, they cannot read or modify it.
- __Privacy and Security:__ https protects the privacy and security of website users by preventing hackers to passively listen to communication between the browser and the server.
- __Faster Performance:__ https increases the speed of data transfer compared to http by encrypting and reducing the size of the data.
- __SEO:__ Use of https increases SEO ranking. In Google Chrome, Google shows the Not Secure label in the browser if users' data is collected over http.
- __Future:__ https represents the future of the web by making internet safe for users and website owners.
