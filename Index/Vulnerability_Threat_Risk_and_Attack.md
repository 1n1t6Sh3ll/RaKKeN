## Vulnerability

__Vulnerability__  – A vulnerability is a weakness or gap in our protection efforts.
Weaknesses or gaps in a security program that can be exploited by threats to gain unauthorized access to an asset.

A vulnerability refers to a known weakness of an asset (resource) that can be exploited by one or more attackers. In other words, it is a known issue that allows an attack to succeed. 

A vulnerability is a Weakness or fault in the security system that can lead to an exposure. Vulnerabilities simply refer to weaknesses in a system. They make threat outcomes possible and potentially even more dangerous. A system could be exploited through a single vulnerability. 

For example,

__1.__ a  particular system may be vulnerable to unauthorized data manipulation because the system does not verify a  user's identity before allowing data access.

__2.__ a single SQL Injection attack could give an attacker full control over sensitive data. An attacker could also chain several exploits together, taking advantage of more than one vulnerability to gain more control.

- Weak input validation
- Unchecked buffers
- Weak session management
- Incorrect crypto implementation



## Threat

__Threat__ – A threat is what we’re trying to protect against.
Anything that can exploit a vulnerability, intentionally or accidentally, and obtain, damage, or destroy an asset.


Threat can be anything that can take advantage of a vulnerability to breach security and negatively alter, erase, harm object or objects of interest.
- Siphon off funds
- Steal credit cards
- Deny access to all users
- Order books on behalf of others

A threat refers to a new or newly discovered incident that has the potential to harm a system or your company overall. There are three main types of threats:

- Natural threats, such as floods, hurricanes, or tornadoes
- Unintentional threats, like an employee mistakenly accessing the wrong information
- Intentional threats, such as spyware, malware, adware companies, or the actions of a disgruntled employee


## Attack 

An attempt to gain unauthorized access to information resource or services, or to cause harm or damage to information systems. An attack is an information security threat that involves an attempt to obtain, alter, destroy, remove, implant or reveal information without authorized access or permission. It happens to both individuals and organizations.

- SQL Injection
- Cross Site Scripting
- Brute Force
- Variable Manipulation


## Asset

__Asset__ - An asset is what we’re trying to protect.
People, property, and information.  People may include employees and customers along with other invited persons such as contractors or guests.  Property assets consist of both tangible and intangible items that can be assigned a value.  Intangible assets include reputation and proprietary information.  Information may include databases, software code, critical company records, and many other intangible items.



## Risk

Risk is defined as the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. Examples of risk include financial losses, loss of privacy, reputational damage, legal implications, and even loss of life.

Risk can also be defined as follows:

Risk = Threat X Vulnerability
